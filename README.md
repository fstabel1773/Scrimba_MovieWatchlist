# About this repo

This repo contains a solo project from Scrimba frontend career path, module 9, working with APIs. The project is a Movie watchlist which uses the OMDb API. Users can search for Movies and store them to their watchlist.
I built the project on my own and from scratch, following a figma design-pattern and the basic requirements.
